This is my nix-flake based C++ development environment. 

# Dependencies

- Nix
- Direnv

# Usage

After making a new repository with this template, you must run `echo "use flake >> .envrc && direnv allow` in your project directory.
You may also want to change the license, especially if you are not me.
